A modern, fully open-source FPV drone flight controller supporting 4S  to 6S LiPo batteries.






## Features


- 6 UART Ports – Plenty of connectivity for receivers, GPS, telemetry, and more

- 4 Dedicated LED Ports – Easily add external lighting for visibility and feedback

- MicroSD Card Slot – Supports BlackBox logging for performance tuning and diagnostics

- USB-C Port – Fast, modern, and reliable data/power connection

- DJI Compatible – Seamless integration with DJI FPV systems

- Battery Status LEDs – Instantly check power levels with onboard indicator lights

- Accessible Solder Pads – Designed for easy wiring and maintenance

 ### Key Components
- STM32F405RGTx Microcontroller – Powerful 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 for high-performance flight control

- HMC5883L Magnetometer – Accurate heading and compass data

- MPU-6000 Gyroscope/Accelerometer – Industry-standard motion tracking for stable flight

- BMP280 Barometer – Precise altitude sensing for advanced flight modes


## Appendix

The firmware source code is available in the 'code' branch.

The KiCad design files can be found in the master branch.

While 3S LiPo batteries are untested, they should work. Designed for optimal use with 6S.
